# Sizelist
This lists all files and subdirectories in a directory in order of size to see what is taking up so much space.

## Install
First, ensure `fzf` is installed. Fzf is not installed with apt in the script, as it can mess with fzf installed in other ways.
```sh
sudo apt install fzf
```
Then run the install script:
```sh
bash ./install.sh
```
